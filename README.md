# UFOs
Boot Camp Module 11

## Overview
For centuries people around the world have reported encounters with beings who are not from our Earth.  One investor in particular has made it possible for us to build a site that catalogs reports of UFO sightings.  This site will allow users to filter sighting data based on several critera.  This would allow a person to compare the details of their encounter with that of others.  Did anyone else see a "car type object in the sky" in North Carolina? 


## Results
In order for a user to compare the details of their alien encouter with others, they simply type their info into the search fields on the left hand side of the page.  Ideally, this would create a filtered table of results that match the user input.  I was able to [print the filters to my console.log](console_log.PNG) as well as add objects to the filter list, but I couldn't get the data to actually filter.

## Summary
There are a couple of drawbacks to this web page.  One is that the data could be cleaned.  When looking through the table data, I noticed the [values for duration were not uniform.](dirty_data.PNG) I would also allow for a ranged input in the date filter.  Another improvment would be to allow users to submit their own sigting information.
